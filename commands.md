# Commands Basics
List of useful commands!

## Running the App
### Running Nodemon
First I installed nodemon locally. So, you have to use the npx command to run nodemon:

```bash
npx nodemon app.js
```

If you are not choosing to use nodemon then you have to run it using the node command. This is a useful command, so I am putting it down:

```bash
node app.js
```


### Looking at the App

To see you app on the browser, you have to go to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
